Patient Management System

We need a web-based application to help our healthcare facility manage patient records and appointments more efficiently. Here's what we're looking for:

First, we need a secure way for our staff members to create accounts and log in to the system. They should be able to register with basic information like their name, email, and a password. Once registered, they can log in using their credentials.

The main part of the application is the patient management section. After logging in, our staff should have access to a comprehensive list of all our patients. This list should display important details like the patient's name, date of birth, contact information, and any relevant medical history or allergies. We have a large number of patients, so the list should be organized in a way that makes it easy to search for specific patients or filter the list based on various criteria.

When a patient has an upcoming appointment, our staff should be able to easily access and view the appointment details, such as the date, time, reason for the visit, and any notes or instructions related to the appointment.

When a new patient needs to be added to our system, our staff should have a straightforward way to do so, like a button or link that opens up a form. In this form, they can enter the patient's personal and medical information, as well as any upcoming appointment details.

For existing patients, there should be options to edit or update their records. If a staff member needs to edit a patient's information, the form should open up with the current details already filled in, so they can make changes easily. There should also be a way to add new appointment details or update existing appointments for a patient.

Finally, our staff members should be able to log out of the system securely when they're done.
